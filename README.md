# Horch Motorsport
This is motor magazine website showcasing skills using only CSS and HTML, as my first web project of all times.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (including custom fonts from Google Fonts)


## Features
- Responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes. It was my first time trying a responsive design
- CSS hover animations, like transform
- News section with images and custom fonts

## Process
This project was a great opportunity for me to practice my front-end development skills, particularly in animations. I struggled a lot with everything related to CSS, as it was my first time using and understanding it, but I learned a lot in the process. This project was definitly a great opportunity to learn front-end skills to then be applied and improve in my next projects, as my portfolio.
## Conclusions and Learnings
Throughout the process of building this website, I learned the basics of web structure and CSS decorations. I also learned how to effectively deploy the website to be visible to everyone. Additionally, I tried to use a responsive design, and the fails behind this design has been my biggest learning experience to make them right on my next websites 

Overall, this project was a huge learning experience and a great opportunity to begin in website development.
